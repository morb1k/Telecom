# Telecom Material Calculator

This repository contains a small React application that generates a telecom site material list based on several site parameters.

## Running

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. The page loads React and Babel from public CDNs so no build step is required.

## Features

- Adjustable site type, canopy, cable run, microwave flag, and optional site ID.
- Automatic calculation of conduit lengths and material quantities.
- Buttons to copy, download, print, or save/load presets for the material list.
